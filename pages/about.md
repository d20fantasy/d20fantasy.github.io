This is the website for D20Fantasy, a group of four dumb-asses playing Dungeons and Dragons and for some reason recording it so other people can listen to our attempts to do some cooperative story telling.

We are playing a very-slightly home-brewed version of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

- Barret is played by Ben
- Tal is played by Obie
- Zeke is played by Dennis
- and the DM is played by Earl

Please don't have high expecations of us. We're trying, okay?
