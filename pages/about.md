My name is Earl Duque, ServiceNow System Administrator and Lead Developer at UC Davis Informational and Educational Technology.

The goal here is to have a continuous repo of things I've made: useful, fun, and anything and everything in between.

I almost make a lot of dumb stuff, so good luck to you trying to wade through that.
