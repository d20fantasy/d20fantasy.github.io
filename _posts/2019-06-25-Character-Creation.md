For you suckers that have decided to join this campaign <!--endexcerpt-->

<span style="font-size: 24px;">Create a character</span>

*   You should have chosen "Create a character" when you were sent the invite link
*   Read each section below before filling out the corresponding page
*   Feel free to read descriptions of everything before deciding
*   It's okay to backtrack through pages if you change your mind later
*   Don't worry about your ability numbers for a while.

Key

*   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Underline means you need to actively do something for this option</span>
*   **bold is the option that is being referred to**
*   <span style="color: #999999;">Grey text is a "Hey look, this is different than 1st edition"</span>

* * *

1.  <span style="font-size: 18px;">Character Name and Character Preferences (Home)</span>
    1.  You can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pick your name</span>. If you want a recommendation, pick a name that fits the race you will eventually choose
    2.  Leave **Sources** as is (Homebrew Content, Magic: The Gathering Content, and Eberron Content)
    3.  Leave **Advancement Type** as is (Milestone). <span style="color: #999999;">Leveling will be informed by XP but I will advance you by level at my discretion, we will no longer have to travel to towns either to do so.</span>
    4.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Change </span>**Hit Point Type** to Manual. <span style="color: #999999;">Our system will be 1st level you will take the recommended starting HP (usually it's 8+) and then for every level after you can choose to take the average+constitution bonus or roll randomly +constitution bonus.</span>
    5.  Leave **Use Prerequisites** as is (Feats and Multiclass Requirements are both true)
    6.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Change </span>**Encumbrance Type** to No Encumbrance. <span style="color: #999999;">No more weight checks, I will be asking you to make sure to offload things whenever you get back to town.</span>
    7.  Leave **Ignore Coin Weight** to true. <span style="color: #999999;">I will be telling you GP equivalence for everything and they all weight nothing now.</span>
    8.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You choose</span> **Ability Score/Modifier Display,** but I recommend the default Modifiers Top because you will be using them a lot in 5E. 
    9.  Leave **Character Privacy** as Public
2.  <span style="font-size: 18px;">Choose a race</span>
    1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Change </span>**Filter Race Source(s)** to Player's Handbook. You must pick a race from this filter.
    2.  But from that filtered list, you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">choose</span> any race and sub-race from there.
        1.  Clicking on each race and sub-race will bring up a description of that race and a summary of the special things they get game-wise (like attribute bonuses and special skills). It's a lot to read but a LOT of neat things are included in races now in 5E so the more time you spend the better informed you'll be. <span style="color: #999999;">Notice that there are no longer any negatives for certain races, and humans get +1 to _every_ attribute. A lot of races also get a special Archetype (like specialization) when you hit level 2 or 3\. Speed (how far you can move in a round) is also determined mostly by race now.</span>
        2.  I _recommend_ listening to what they say about the alignment, I'd prefer that you pick an alignment later that matches the race's expected alignment
        3.  There is a "Details Page" for each class that will tell you some GREAT role playing perspectives about the race. It's a lot for each race though so at a minimum, use the summaries to decide and then save the details page for later when you've pick one.
    3.  After choosing a race you will be shown the overview again and you can see the special stuff you get.
    4.  _For those that have options to choose_ from (like cantrip spells or the extra language you get to know) it will ask you to choose that now. For things that need explanation (like cantrip spells) pick one from the list and it will show you what it exactly is after the selection.
3.  <span style="font-size: 18px;">Choose a class</span>
    1.  There are _a lot_ of choices to start off with. **All are valid choices** for you to pick from (I'm not restricting any class), I do reserve the right to nerf things that might be too powerful in my opinion.
    2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please do not multi-class</span>
    3.  The only thing I'll ask of you all is to try and **chooses classes to complement the team**. Try not to overlap too much in the same "realm of expertise"
    4.  <span style="color: #999999;">Again, note that your starting hit points is determined by the section that says "Hit Points at 1st Level". Eg. a person choosing Barbarian will start with 12 hit points + their constitution modifier.</span>
    5.  <span style="color: #999999;">Do not worry about your starting money. Generally, you are given one of everything that you are proficient with.</span>
    6.  <span style="color: #999999;">Magic-User from 1E is most closely related to Wizard now. There are nuances between the three "magic" classes:</span>
        1.  <span style="color: #999999;">A wizard passes the class because she studies hard</span>
        2.  <span style="color: #999999;">A sorcerer is so talented that she passes without studying</span>
        3.  <span style="color: #999999;">A warlock gets an A by sleeping with the teacher.</span>
    7.  <span style="color: #000000;">After you choose your class you be brought to the class summary page where you need to do the following:</span>  

        1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Click</span> **Manage HP** and set it to the "Total Possible HP" value and save. Note that this number will automatically go up later if you roll a good constitution ability.
        2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choose</span> any **Class Features** at this point (denoted by a blue exclamation point)
        3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choose</span> your **Spells** if you have any
4.  <span style="font-size: 18px;">Ability Scores</span>
    1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Change</span> **Choose a Generation Method** to "Point Buy"
    2.  <span style="color: #999999;">Alright, ability scores is a lot different now. </span>
        1.  <span style="color: #999999;">You can only choose scores up to 15 now (15 is actually quite good now). While it was fun to roll 18s and stuff, if you noticed earlier, your attributes will go up over time (as opposed to 1E where they were pretty much fixed) _and_ race selection always adds to the number. So you might get 18 eventually!</span> 
        2.  <span style="color: #999999;">Ability scores are almost entirely about the "Modifier" that comes with it now. Eg. if you are a fighter, a 15 in strength means you roll +2 to everything regarding attacks. +2 intelligence modifier for magic-users means +2 to everything about spells, etc.</span>
        3.  <span style="color: #999999;">8 or 9 ability is -1 modifier  
            10 or 11 ability is +0 modifier  
            12 or 13 ability is +1 modifier  
            14 or 15 ability is +2 modifier and so on in that pattern</span>
        4.  <span style="color: #999999;">Play with the point buy system and see how all the racial and other bonuses factor into the final score.</span>
        5.  <span style="color: #999999;">Notice that the way the higher ability scores are weighted means that you can choose to have three 15s (with three 8s) to get those three abilities to have good modifiers, but you can also potentially do three 13s with three 12s and thus have a +1 modifier to _every_ stat. It's up to you.</span>
    3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Do not use "Other Modifiers" or "Override Score"</span></span></span></span>
5.  <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;">Description</span></span></span>
    1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;">Choose</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"> <span style="color: #000000;">a **Background**. You can pick one then read up on it. Again, it's a lot, <span style="color: #999999;">but this determines what special features, languages, and proficiencies you get</span>. You can do custom and follow the guide, but if you do, I want you to actually write a description similar to the other ones.</span></span></span>
    2.  <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding **Suggested Characteristics**</span></span></span>
        1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;">Choose or randomly roll TWO</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;"> **Personality Traits**</span></span></span>
        2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;">Choose or randomly roll ONE</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;"> **Ideal**</span></span></span>
        3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;">Choose or randomly roll ONE</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;"> **Bond**</span></span></span>
        4.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;">Choose or randomly roll ONE</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000;"> **Flaw**</span></span></span>
    3.  Regarding **Character Details**  

        1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choose</span> an **Alignment**. I'm going to ask not to choose an evil alignment. Remember your racial tendency.
        2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choose</span> a **Faith** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if it makes sense for your class/race to have one, or if you want one regardless.</span>
        3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choose</span> a **Lifestyle **(starting money won't make much a difference so choose mainly for role playing purposes)
    4.  Regarding **Physical Characteristics**
        1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choose</span> **Hair, Skin, Eyes, and Gender Description **to your liking (and relatively makes sense for your race).
        2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choose</span> **Height, Weight, and Age** according to your race.
    5.  Your **Personal Characteristics** should be pre-filled from what you chose in **Suggested Characteristics. **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> choose to edit them now but only to add more detail or perhaps backstory to why.
    6.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may</span> edit the **Notes** section at your discretion.
6.  <span style="font-size: 18px;">Equipment</span>
    1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If</span> you have **Attuned Magic Items** available, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">choose them</span>
    2.  For **Starting Equipment**, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">choose</span> Equipment <span style="color: #999999;">(not gold)</span>  

        1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow the prompts</span> to determine your starting equipment
        2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select</span> **Add Starting Equipment** when done.
    3.  Under **Inventory** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">select Wield or Wear</span> for anything that you want to be your "default loadout"
    4.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not add any other items to your inventory.</span> <span style="color: #999999;">For clerics/magic-users, do not worry about your spell components if they are any. We are going to assume you always have the components you need. For spells with expensive or relatively rare components, we'll address those individually.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">That's it! You made your character, you can view the finalized live sheet or export it for print out.</span>

*   <span style="color: #000000;">You can use either the online sheet or a printed sheet while we play. If the latter, I will ask you to asap update the online one after sessions.</span>
*   <span style="color: #000000;">At this point, don't worry about anything else besides going through your character sheet and learning more about your character choices. <span style="color: #999999;">I'll teach you about all the new stuff on your character sheet when we play!</span></span>
*   <span style="color: #000000;">If you want, you can:</span>
    *   <span style="color: #000000;">add more backstory b</span>ut I will choose how you all know each other at the story of the story
    *   you can read through the player's handbook (available on this website under "Sources" and then choose "Player's Handbook" under the sourcebook
