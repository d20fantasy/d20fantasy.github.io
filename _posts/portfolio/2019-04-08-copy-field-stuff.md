I created a Quality-of-life enhancement for developers to be able to quickly "Copy Field Name", "Copy Field Value", or "Copy Field Display Value"<!--endexcerpt--> any form field to their clipboard for later use.

The update set can be downloaded on [the share website](https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/share/contents/1655773_add_copy_variable_name_to_context_menu_for_form_variables?t=PRODUCT_DETAILS).
