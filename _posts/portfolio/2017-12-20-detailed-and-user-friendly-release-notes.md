Some implementations are only as good as their documentation. One of the earliest things I implemented when I joined UC Davis was the push to have good release notes; good in terms of being both detailed and user-friendly, which means being able to explain what we are exactly releasing but without losing the customer in technical jargon.<!--endexcerpt-->

Some examples of release notes that I created:

- [ServiceNow Release 6.06 Release Notes](/assets/pdf/Release Notes Example 1.pdf)
- [ServiceNow Release 8.0.0 - Madrid Release Notes](/assets/pdf/Release Notes Example 2.pdf)

Shout out to Tobi Paton for being my go-to proof reader for these release notes.
