## What is it?

Yay Food is an applet that I created for me and my wife because we would often visit a restaurant and find ourselves asking "What did we like here? What did we not like here? What have we already tried?"

Yay Food is our way of being able to document and remember our individual ratings for food whether we are on a computer or on our phone.<!--endexcerpt-->

## Have we actually used the data as intended

Yes!

## Why is it called Yay Food

Because Yay, Food! Also, it fits our #yayduque wedding hash tag.

## Can I use it too?

Yes, just visit [food.yayduque.com](http://food.yayduque.com) to get started. Follow the instructions below to see how we set the "applet" up on our phones.

#### 1. Create your own group

## How was this made?

This was made entirely in ServiceNow, an enterprise cloud software, by me! It's a few database tables with a Service Portal interface.
