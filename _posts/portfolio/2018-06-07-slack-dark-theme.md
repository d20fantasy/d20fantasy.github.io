Every developer knows how frustrating it can be to use a program that has no available dark theme. How does such a widely-used program like Slack not have a default dark theme?<!--endexcerpt--> Well until then, I created a open-sourced project to create one. In its first year of availability it has grown to more than a dozen contributors, 100 stars, and half-as-many forks.

The GitHub repository with instructions on how to install this dark theme can be found [here](https://github.com/earlduque/Slack-Dark-Theme).
