At ServiceNow's Knowledge 2018 conference, attended by 18,000+, I competed in the annual Hackathon.<!--endexcerpt--> Dozens of teams, comprised of one to three individuals each, raced to build a solution within eight hours entirely within the ServiceNow platform.

My solo-member team was a finalist (top 10)!

I created a multiplayer text adventure (otherwise known as a MUD/Multi-User Dungeon) within a ServiceNow Service Portal. Users were able to interact with and navigate through a simulated "dungeon" using ServiceNow's live-chat interface. If users were in the same room as other users, they were able to chat with each other and even complete objectives together.

I even [live-streamed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DiJTh-x-IY) my progress.

More of a fun, working concept, my entry understandably was not crowned a winner... but I definitely won a lot of nerd-cred and met some awesome developers!

The talented winners and other finalists can be found in this great [community blog of the event](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=2213cba6dbbd13002b6dfb651f9619b1) by keeshenniphof.

Unfortunately, the instance that this was running on has since been re-claimed. If I find the update sets, I'll re-host it and post the link here.

The basic concept of how it worked can be found in my GitHub repository of the [Player Controller Business Rule](https://github.com/earlduque/SN-404-ADV/blob/master/Hackathon/404%20Player%20Controller.js).
