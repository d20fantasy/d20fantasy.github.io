The song that plays at the beginning of every D20 Fantasy episode is made by me! In episode five I even extended it a little. You can hear it [here](https://soundcloud.com/earl-duque/d20-fantasy-extended) or embedded below.

The podcast (in addition to spotify, itunes, and google play) is now on Alexa, so you can even say "Alexa play D20 Fantasy podcast"!

This has been a fun creative outlet, we don't believe this will be big or anything, it's just for fun! Shout out to our regular listeners, all like 6 of you, lolol.
